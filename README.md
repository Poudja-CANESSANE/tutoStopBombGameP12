# Stop Bomb
This project is the 12th of the iOS Developer path from OpenClassrooms. [See demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8q095Fd6TE).   
In this tutorial I teach you how to build a simple 2D game with SpriteKit.
The goal of this game is to stop the bomb just before it explodes to get a gratifying appreciation.
The difficulty is that the timer disappears at a certain moment. We have the possibility to choose the difficulty, the duration of the timer and to pause the game.
